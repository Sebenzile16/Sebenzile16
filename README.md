### Welcome to my Github Profile

I am currently working on launching my own personal website.
I am currently learning Javascript and I am using that in order to be able to get website running, of course while also learning the pipelines required to do so

I have some experience in dealing with the following programming languages: HtmL, CSS, Javascript, Java. I have also had a bit of experience in learning about the following command line languages bash and powershell for linux and windows respectively.

My github is a bit all over the place as I am trying to get a grasp of the things I want to do, and trying to learn how to do them, and the right language or best language for the job.

Thank you for stopping by and hopefully you will enjoy the experience
